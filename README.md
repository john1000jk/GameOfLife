# GameOfLife

Here is a personal project that incorporates the model-view-controller design pattern with a Java Swing GUI.

## Elements

The program files can all be found in the src/conway folder. 
Each of the specific model, view, and controller classes are named accordingly. 
The main file that runs the program is labeled GameOfLife.java.
Let me know what you think!
